# Week 5: Automation Framework Lab

## Overview
This lab demonstrates the transition from manual testing to an automated framework. 
We use **Pytest** to execute test suites based on the programs in `src/`.

## Testing Methodology Mapping
Students must categorize their 15 test cases per program as follows:
- **BVA (Boundary Value Analysis):** Testing exact edges (e.g., password length of 8).
- **Negative Testing:** Attempting to force an error (e.g., debiting more than balance).
- **Black-Box:** Testing based on requirements (input/output) without viewing code.
- **White-Box:** Testing specific `if/else` paths within the source files.
